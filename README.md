# Heart Disease Risk Classifier

Here you'll find a solution to selecting and training a classification model to predict the risk for heart disease, putting it to a web service using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) and then containerizing it using docker.

## The problem

The [risk for heart disease](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/risk_factors.htm) can be associated with health conditions and factors such as lifestyle, age, and family history. A binary classification model based on these variables collected from patients can help in healthcare diagnosis.
